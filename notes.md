# Narrative

- Start with a small convnet to predict digit labels
- Add DS routing to short-circuit the network, saving computation
- Compare with CR routing

# Experiments

- Static routing vs. dynamic routing (experiment 1)
- Decision smoothing vs. cost regression (experiment 1)
- Trees vs. cascades (experiment 1)
- Smart routing vs. dumb routing (test informally)
- Optimistic vs. pragmatic cost regression (test informally)
- Generalization error estimation (test informally)
- Subsignal routing (experiment 2)
- Spiking (experiment 3)
- Growing vs. planting (possible follow-up study)
